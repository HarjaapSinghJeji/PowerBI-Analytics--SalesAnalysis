# Microsoft Power BI - Up & Running with Power BI Desktop

I recently completed the **"Microsoft Power BI - Up & Running with Power BI Desktop"** course on Udemy, and I wanted to share my experience with you all. This course gave me a solid foundation to Power BI, a super powerful business analytics tool by Microsoft. 

Here are some of the key topics we covered:

**Getting Started with Power BI Desktop**: I learned about the interface, basic features, and how to set up my workspace.

**Importing and Transforming Data**: This section was all about connecting to various data sources, importing data, and using the Power Query Editor for data transformation.

**Data Modeling**: I learned how to create relationships between different data tables, use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculated columns and measures, and understand the data model.

**Visualizations**: I got to explore different types of visualizations like bar charts, line charts, maps, and more. I also learned how to customize visualizations and use slicers for interactive filtering.

**Building Reports and Dashboards**: Finally, I learned how to combine visualizations to create comprehensive reports, design user-friendly dashboards, and share insights with others.


## Skills I gained from this project:

Importing and cleaning data from various sources to prepare it for analysis.

Creating complex data models to uncover insights and trends.

Designing interactive and visually appealing reports and dashboards.

Utilizing DAX to perform advanced data analysis.

Sharing and collaborating on Power BI reports with colleagues and stakeholders.
